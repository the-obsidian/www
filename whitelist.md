To help build a quality community, we currently require our players to request access to our whitelist.  This helps reduce the number of drive-by griefers who would otherwise have access to do harm to the server.  We try to respond to whitelist requests quickly, though you may experience some delay if it is outside of daylight hours in the United States.  Please be sure to read our [Community Guidelines](/rules/) before submitting your application.

Welcome to the community!

Please fill out the whitelist application using "Continue Discussion" below - we will follow up with you via the forum messaging system.

<div id="discourse-comments"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: '{{ site.discourse_url }}',
                     topicId: 170 };
  (function() {
    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;
    d.src = DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';
    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);
  })();
